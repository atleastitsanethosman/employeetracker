  # Installation
  
  In order to install this application, the user will need to download associated files, and be sure to install nodeJS on their machine.  The user will also need to install mySql, create an instance and ensure it is running on their machine.  There is a database schema and seed files written in SQL that can be used to create the database and load with test data if desired, there are also csv files included if the user prefers to import test data with those.  The user will need to navigate to the directory in their terminal and run the command ```npm i``` to install the correct nodeJS packages.<br>
  
  # Usage
  
The user will need to navigate to the primary directory housing the application and then enter the command ```npm start``` or ```node index``` to start the application.  The user will then be given a series of menus with available operations and prompts for needed data to work with records in the database.  A demo video is linked below. <br>
